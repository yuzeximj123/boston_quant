                    Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I have traced the Rebel spies 
                    to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.

                    Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. This time, let go 
                    your conscious self and act on instinct. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. You're all clear, kid. 
                    Let's blow this thing and go home!

                    I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater 
                    artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper 
                    surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw 
                    myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants 
                    are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless 
                    indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image.
